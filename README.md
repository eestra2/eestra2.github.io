Hello World! This is my website's repository and it is currently under construction. I hope to bring content that will educate and empower people to use python programming to automate the repetitive tasks and carry-out data driven research. Content will be specifically aimed at business/financial oriented audiences looking to break out of that basic-python level where it's just coding with boring material that seems to not have any real-world connection to what you want to do with it.
